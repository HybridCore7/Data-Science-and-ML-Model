for begineers
This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is the famous U.S.A Housing Dataset, which includes features such as the OveraQual, lot size, and year built.

Prepare the dataset:

Download the dataset from Kaggle.
Place the downloaded files in the data/ directory.

  Train the model:

" train = pd.read_csv('E:ML/Kaggle/House_Pricing/train.csv') "

  The dataset used in this project is the Ames Housing Dataset. It includes various features related to the physical and locational aspects of houses. The data is divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation

Modeling
We explore several machine learning algorithms for house price prediction, including:

 1. Linear Regression
 2. GRADIENT DESCENT METHOD

Results

The best-performing model was Gradient Boosting with the following metrics:

 1 . MsE: XXXX
 2 . RMSE: XXXX
